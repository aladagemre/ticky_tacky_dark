Here's some cool text on a cool page.  That image on the left?  It'll randomly change on load between the ones in "sideimages".

<br><a href="javascript:toggleDisplay('drop_stuff');">Stuff that drops down when you click on it:</a>
	<div id="drop_stuff" style="display:none">
        This stuff drops down because you clicked on the text.
	</div>
